All our text goes here. Reference figures with the R chuck label as
Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:fcast-finalized}.

All figures go on their own page after all of the text\ldots{}

Edit \texttt{pnas-suppl-template.tex} for the correct Author list and
Title.

\section{Examining the relative advantage of using finalized rather than
vintage
data}\label{examining-the-relative-advantage-of-using-finalized-rather-than-vintage-data}}

This section referes to
Figures\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:fcast-finalized}--\ref{fig:hot-honest-v-finalized}.

\hypertarget{aggregating-with-geometric-mean}{%
\section{Aggregating with geometric
mean}\label{aggregating-with-geometric-mean}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The weighted interval score is bounded below by zero and can be very
  large. This behavior is typical of right-skewed distributions.
\item
  Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:wis-densities} illustrates that the
  densities appear log-Gaussian.
\item
  This suggests aggregating by the geometric mean rather than the mean
  for comparisons. See Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:fcast-adjusted}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{bootstrap-results}{%
\section{Bootstrap results}\label{bootstrap-results}}

Here we discuss how implicit regularization is not the reason for
improved performance

\hypertarget{correlations-with-lagged-actuals}{%
\section{Correlations with lagged
actuals}\label{correlations-with-lagged-actuals}}

Alden's histograms are in Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:cor-wis-ratio}
and Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:cor-wis-ratio-m1}.

\hypertarget{upswings-and-downswings}{%
\section{Upswings and Downswings}\label{upswings-and-downswings}}

Logged version of Figure 5 in the manuscript is in
Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:upswing-histogram-logged}.

See also Table\textasciitilde{}\ref{tab:upswing-corr-table}.

\hypertarget{leadingness-and-laggingness}{%
\section{Leadingness and
laggingness}\label{leadingness-and-laggingness}}

Currently, both figures are in the manuscript. Probably just need text
here.

\hypertarget{examining-data-in-2021}{%
\section{Examining data in 2021}\label{examining-data-in-2021}}

See Figures \ref{fig:fcast-alldates} -- \ref{fig:hot-alldates}.

\hypertarget{deprecated}{%
\section{Deprecated}\label{deprecated}}

There are a few blocks at the bottom (figures with Google symptoms only
and the old trajectory plots) that we can remove once we decide.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:upswing-corr-table}Correlation of the difference in WIS between the AR model with the difference in median predictions. In down periods, improvements in forecast risk are highly correlated with lower median predictions. The opposite is true in up periods. This suggests, as one might expect that improved performance of the indicator-assisted model is attributable to being closer to the truth then the AR model. This conclusion is stronger in down periods then in up periods.}
